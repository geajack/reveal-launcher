# Reveal Launcher

This is a GNOME extension that lets you right click on application icons in the launcher and find the corresponding .desktop file easily.

This is only for personal use. It won't work if you're using the wrong version of gnome-shell (I'm using 3.36) or if you don't use the `nemo` file manager.

To use it, make a folder in `.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/reveal-launcher@geajack.github.com` and put all these files in it. Then run

```
gnome-extensions enable reveal-launcher@geajack.github.com
```

and possibly restart gnome-shell by pressing F2 to open the command runner and typing `restart`.
